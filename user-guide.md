**You do NOT need:**

## Two-Stage Workflow

### STAGE 1: Quality Gate & Critical Analysis

#### Step 1: Start Your Review
Click your team's AI Review Assistant link and type one of these:
- `"Start new ARR project review"`
- `"Start new IFM project review"`
- `"Help me review a project"`

#### Step 2: Provide Developer Name
The assistant will ask: *"What's the developer name for this [PROJECT_TYPE] project?"*

Simply type the developer name, like: `"Piri"`

#### Step 3: Upload Documents
The assistant will ask for documents **one at a time**:

**First:** *"Please upload the Project description"*
- Upload your main project document
- Wait for confirmation before moving to next document

**Second:** *"Please upload any additional documents"*  
- Upload financial models, technical reports, etc.
- You can upload multiple additional documents
- Wait for confirmation

#### Step 4: Review Stage 1 Output
The assistant will provide **four sections**:

1. **Analysis Table** - Structured scoring (1-4 scale) with **direct quotes and sources** for every claim
2. **Document Critique** - Discrepancies, missing info, data quality issues (with quotes)
3. **Structure Compliance** - How your docs compare to Carbon Direct template format
4. **Questions for You** - Specific clarifications needed

#### Step 5: Address Questions & Issues
- Review the critique and questions carefully
- Provide clarifications or additional documents as requested
- Fix any major discrepancies identified
- **Don't proceed to Stage 2 until issues are resolved**

### STAGE 2A: Carbon Direct Bullet Structure

#### Step 6: Request Bullet Structure
Once Stage 1 issues are addressed, type:
- `"Create final document"`
- `"Generate full report"`

#### Step 7: Review Carbon Direct Bullet Format
The assistant will provide the exact Carbon Direct template structure:
- **Overview** (200-300 words): Project summary and quality impression
- **Highlights**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Data gaps, Conclusions (max 3 bullets each)
- **Project Scores**: 1-4 scale for quality criteria and data completeness
- **Technical Assessment Sections**: Social harms, Environmental harms, Additionality, MMRV, Durability, Leakage
- **Each section includes**: Main points, context, direct quotes with sources, **Actions for analyst**

#### Step 8: Review and Approve Structure
Review the bullet structure carefully:
- **Verify all quotes and sources** are accurate
- **Check that actions are clear** for analyst completion
- **Confirm scoring aligns** with evidence provided

Then either:
- Say `"Start section-by-section"` if structure looks good
- Provide specific feedback to adjust bullet points or actions

### STAGE 2B: Section-by-Section Collaboration

#### Step 9: Start Collaborative Building
After bullet structure approval, say:
- `"Start section-by-section"`

#### Step 10: Work Through Each Section
The assistant will work through 9 sections one at a time:
1. **Present section draft** based on your approved bullets
2. **Ask for your feedback** on that specific section
3. **Generate final section** with your input incorporated
4. **Move to next section** and repeat

**Section order:** Overview → Highlights → Project Scores → Social Harms → Environmental Harms → Additionality → MMRV → Durability → Leakage

#### Step 11: Provide Section Feedback
For each section, you can:
- Say **"Looks good, next section"** to approve and continue
- Provide **specific feedback**: "Add more detail on monitoring" or "Include comparison to Project X"
- Request **changes** before moving forward

#### Step 12: Receive Complete Document
After all 9 sections are completed, you'll have a comprehensive Carbon Direct format document with:
- **All sections refined** based on your feedback
- **Complete quotes** with (Document Name, p.X) format
- **Professional formatting** ready for use
