  - File size: _____ MB
  - Format: _____
- [ ] **Prior IFM Reviews** compilation
  - File size: _____ MB
  - Number of example reviews: _____
  - Date range of examples: _____

### ✅ Additional Project Types
- [ ] List other project types: _____________________

## Per-Review User Uploads (NOT Pre-loaded to GPT)
**These documents are uploaded by users during each conversation:**
- Project Document (varies by project) - uploaded via ChatGPT file attachment
- Financial Model (varies by project) - uploaded via ChatGPT file attachment  
- Developer Name (text input) - typed during conversation

**Important:** These are NOT uploaded to the GPT knowledge base. They are handled through ChatGPT's normal conversation file upload feature during each review session.

## File Size Optimization Notes
- **ChatGPT Knowledge Base Limits:** ~20MB per file, ~100MB total
- **Large File Strategy:** 
  - If Prior Reviews > 20MB, split into multiple files
  - Consider creating "Representative Examples" subset
  - Archive full reviews separately for reference

## Verification Questions
1. Are all shoulds/musts documents current and approved?
2. Do prior reviews represent good quality examples?
3. Are there any missing project types in current workflow?
4. Do we have consistent formatting across all reference documents?

## Next Steps After Audit
1. Optimize file sizes if needed
2. Create GPT behavioral instructions
3. Design conversation flow
4. Set up Custom GPT with knowledge base
